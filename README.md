# About
Rddns is a DynDNS client written in Rust.
Its main use case it to update multiple DynDNS records at once when an update is triggered by another DynDNS client that
can only update one DynDNS entry at a time.
Updates can be triggered by HTTP calls to a HTTP server embedded in rddns or by executing rddns in update mode.

# Features
* Trigger DDNS updates under different conditions.
  * "single-shot" updates on execution
  * HTTP requests to an embedded HTTP server
  * periodically (think of an embedded cron job).
* Different sources for IP addresses
  * IP addresses can be passed as command line or HTTP parameter
  * IP addresses can be read from network interfaces
  * IP addresses can be detected via STUN
  * static IP addresses
  * Multiple IP addresses can be combined to new ones.
    E.g. Combine a dynamically assigned IPv6 subnet with the static IPv6 host parts of all devices in the subnet and update DynDNS entries for all of them.
* Different possibilities to execute DDNS updates
  * Execute DDNS updates by calling HTTP URLs.
    IP addresses can be inserted into the URL, headers or the body.
  * Write IP addresses to files
  * Update DNS records at Cloudflare.

# Usage
Rddns is started by passing a configuration file as parameter.
To update all IP address configurations once call rddns in update mode.

    rddns -c /path/to/config.toml update

To keep rddns running and waiting for conditions that should trigger an DDNS update run.

    rddns -c /path/to/config.toml trigger

Which events should trigger an update must be specified in the configuration file.

The configuration file contains the DynDNS entries that should be updated as well as all other configurable options.
It is described in the exemplary configuration file [example_config.toml](example_config.toml).

# Install
There is however a Docker image available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/sirabien/rddns).
A pre-compiled binary for Linux/amd64 can be downloaded from Artifacts section of the Actions tab.

# Build
To build rddns Rust is required.
Rust install instructions can be found [on the offical Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/install.html) (it is
really easy).
After installing Rust the executable `cargo` will be available.
The release version of rddns can than be build with the following command.

    cargo build --release

This will create the executable `target/release/rddns`.

# License
rddns is released under the [GPLv3](LICENSE.md) license.
